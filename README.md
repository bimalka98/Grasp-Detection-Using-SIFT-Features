# Grasp-Detection ðŸŒ±

Detecting grasp point of an object by matching it with a template image using SIFT features

- Inspired by the paper : [***Grasp Detection under Occlusions Using SIFT Features***](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2021/7619794/)
- Tested on:
    * *OpenCV version :  4.5.2*
    * *Numpy version :  1.20.2*

## RANSAC Algorithm performs poorly when there are large number of outliers

## Improve performance of the RANSAC

Using the method 1 explained in the following paper:

 * ***SIFT Feature Point Matching Based on Improved RANSAC Algorithm*** by Guangjun Shi, Xiangyang Xu, Yaping Dai

Method 2 explained in the paper is not implemented in this code. Because it is not possible to use the method 2 in our scenario where images may be rotated by a large angle. Therefore, cross points are a natural thing in our case.
